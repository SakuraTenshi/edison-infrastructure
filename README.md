# Edison Infrastructure: The Wireless Grid Beneath Your Wheels

## ðŸ”§ What Is Edison?
Edison is an infrastructure-as-a-service platform that transforms existing city light poles into wireless power transmitters, enabling vehicles to charge **in motion**â€”no plugs, no downtime, no massive batteries.

Using **resonant inductive coupling**, Edison-enabled poles deliver energy directly to compatible vehicles traveling nearby. The poles are connected to the local grid and optimized for clean, stable powerâ€”ideally sourced from **nuclear** or other green baseload providers.

## ðŸ§  Why This Matters
- **No more range anxiety**: Vehicles charge while driving, not waiting.
- **Battery-light EVs**: Smaller batteries = cheaper, lighter, and more sustainable cars.
- **Smart infrastructure**: Edison poles can be upgraded, managed remotely, and integrated with smart city systems.
- **Clean power**: We prioritize nuclear and renewables, reducing reliance on lithium and fossil fuels.

## ðŸ’¸ The Business Model
Edison isn't a car company. It's a **grid company**.

- Cities and governments pay to retrofit existing infrastructure.
- Vehicle makers license Edison-compatible receiver modules.
- Drivers or fleets pay per kWh of wireless energy, like a toll system.
- Utilities benefit from stable, predictable load demand.

## ðŸš¦ MVP Vision
- One vehicle prototype (golf cart or light EV) with Edison receiver coil.
- One block of street poles retrofitted with transmitter coils.
- Real-time energy transfer while the vehicle drives. No plug, no pause.
- Dashboard app showing live power usage.

## ðŸ§­ Status
This project is in ideation. Weâ€™re planting the flag, building community, and looking for:
- Engineers who want to help build a prototype.
- City officials open to pilots.
- Clean energy advocates.
- Automakers who see the long game.

## âœŠ Call to Action
Weâ€™re not here to be another car company. Weâ€™re here to **build the grid under the future of transportation.**

If you want to help, fork this. Remix it. Pitch it. Build it. Or just talk to us.

**Edison: Power without pause.**
